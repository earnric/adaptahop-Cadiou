------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HaloMaker is the first step of the pipeline GalICS, from the snapshot of a
n-body simulation ( Gadget, Ramses, enzo, treecode). 
It create a list of halo(and sub-halos). It also compute each halo properties
such as its position, velocity, angular momentum, mass, energy...
Its output are treebrick, this files contains all data computed by HaloMaker,
in order to be used for the merger tree computation, in TreeMaker.

This version offers the prospect of using one of the 2 halo finder available,
a friend of friend algorithm an Adaptahop. Adaptahop unable the user to find
sub-halos and to compute the structure tree of each halo.

View makefile

1/ Enzo related FFLAGS:
   -------------------
 -DHDF: to read Enzo files use the compilation option -DHDF and use LIBS below 
 checking that the path to these libs on your machine is correct
	LIBS    =  -L/sw/lib -ljpeg -lz -lsz -lmfhdf -ldf 	 
 -Dr8:if Enzo outputs were done in double precision 

2/ RAMSES related FFLAGS:
   ---------------------
 -DMETALS: if RAMSES has computed metallicity from stellar feedback and you are reading version 3.0 i/o format

3/ Other simulation related FFLAGS:
   --------------------------------
 -DBIG_RUN: for a normal (as opposed to resimulation) simulation whatever the i/o format.
 -DRENORM: if you are analyzing the DM part of a hydro simulation and want to renormalize 
 the mass of your dark matter particle so as to include the baryons (by pretending they are distributed like the DM):
 this might be useful when one wants to compare a pure DM simulation to its DM + hydro counterpart
 -DANG_MOM_OF_R: if you want the code to output the angular momentum of concentric shells for your DM halos

--------------------parameters and options---------------------------------------

All parameters are contained in file 'input_HaloMaker.dat' 

' Cosmological parameters '
af       : expansion factor at redshift 0
lbox     : size of the box at redshift 0, [lbox] =  MPc
H_f      : hubble constant at redshift 0, [H_f]  = Km/s/MPc
omega_f  : Omega matter at redshift 0
lambda_f : Omega lambda at redshift 0

' Parameters for HaloMaker itself '
npart    : minimum number of particles per halo ( this parameter is used in
both halo finder'
Gdpart   : For Gadget format: total number of particles in the (re)simulation
... necessary if the N-body data files are cut in several pieces.
nsteps   : Number of simulation snapshots to analyze
cdm      : .true. to define the center of haloes and subhalo with its particle closest to the center of mass.
	   .false. to define the center of the halo or subhalo with its particle with the highest density (this density is computed with the action "neighbors of compute_neiKDtree even when FOF is used. For halo that have les than 5*npart particles the particles closest to cdm is used.
agor_file: output file for angular momentum of halos in shell, only if using -DANG_MOM_OF_R option 


' Parameters for the halo finder '
method   : Halofinder and subhalo selection method, choose one of these 4:
	- FOF : use the friend of friend algorithm (halo only)
	- HOP : use Adaptahop, subhaloes are not detected (halo only)
	- DPM : use Adaptahop with the Density Profile method (subahalos and haloes are created by linking any node with its highest density maxima), a subhalo has a lower desnity maximum than its host,but can be more massive.
	- MSM : use Adaptahop with the Most massive Submaxima method (subahalos and haloes are created by choosing the most massive subnode as maxima),  here a subhalo is always less massive than its host.
	- BHM : use Adaptahop with the Branch History Method (take previous timestep into account to create haloes and subhalo), it derived from and uses MSM,  a subhalo is always less massive than its host.
verbose     : .true. for verbose mode.	
megaverbose : .true. for extra verbose mode

' FOF parameters '
b           :  fof parameter "b" (usually b=0.2) eps = b * (mean inter-particular
distance'

' Adaptahop parameters '

nvoisins    : number of neighbors considered for computing the SPH density
nhop        : number of stored nearest neighbors
rhot        : density threshold. Particles with SPH density below this
               density threshold are not selected. This thresholding will
               define a number of connected regions, each of which corresponding
               to a structure. For each of these structures, we aim to 
               build a tree of substructures. Typically, one is interested
               in finding the substructures of highly nonlinear objects. A value
               often taken for rho_threshold is 80, which corresponds roughly
               to friend-of-friend algorithm parameter b=2.

fudge       : density threshold. Particles with SPH density below this
               density threshold are not selected. This thresholding will
               define a number of connected regions, each of which corresponding
               to a structure. For each of these structures, we aim to 
               build a tree of substructures. Typically, one is interested
               in finding the substructures of highly nonlinear objects. A value
               often taken for rho_threshold is 80, which corresponds roughly
               to friend-of-friend algorithm parameter b=2.

fudgeepsilon: this parameter can be seen as an Eulerian version of the thresholding
               controlled by nmembthresh. 
	       It defines the size of the smallest structures
               that can exist physically and is related to force softening.
               Basically, if epsilon is the softening parameter, substructures
	       with typical radius smaller than epsilon are just coincidences
	       and should not be considered. The typical radius of a structure
	       is given by the mean square distance of particles belonging to
	       it with respect to its center of gravity. 
               The criterion for selecting a structure is thus              
               radius_{substructure} > epsilon, where
	       epsilon=fudgeepsilon*L/nbodies^{1/3}. 
	       Fudgeepsilon is thus expressed in units of mean interparticle separation.
              - For a treecode, fudgeepsilon is typically of the order of 1/20;
              - For a PM code, fudgeepsilon is typically of the order of N_g/nbodies^{1/3}
              where N_g is the resolution of the grid used for the force calculations,
              i.e. of the order of 1 or 0.5.
              - For a quasi-Lagrangian code such as RAMSES, putting constrains from fudgeepsilon 
              is not really useful. Basically it corresponds to N_g/nbodies^{1/3} where N_g
              would be the equivalent of the PM grid probed by the smallest AMR cells.              

alphap     : a criterion can be applied to decide whether a substructure
	       is selected or not. Here the choice of  alphap dictates by how
	       much the maximum local density in this substructure should be larger
